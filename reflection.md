- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The Superhero class represents Superman, a superhero with attributes like health, size, and position. The class uses the Contract interface’s methods to give Superman various actions (e.g., grabbing items, flying to coordinates, shrinking, and growing), which modify his attributes to simulate a superhero’s abilities and energy limitations. Each action impacts Superman's state, showcasing how his health and other attributes change with each use. I didn’t add any additional methods beyond those specified in the Contract interface.

What Worked: The structure of implementing an interface worked well, as it provided a clear set of actions for the superhero. Adding print statements helped make attribute changes visible.
What Didn’t Work: There was some initial confusion with implementing all interface methods while making each one meaningful in the context of a superhero, especially when attributes didn’t seem directly useable.
Advice: Start with small tests on each method individually to make sure attributes are updated as expected. Print statements are especially useful for debugging state changes in each method.
